                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
                current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
                got every penny's worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
                looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
                as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
