                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
                current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
                got every penny's worth.

                looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
                as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                recommend!"
